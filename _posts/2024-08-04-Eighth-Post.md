# Goals Check-in

Regarding the OpenSSF ecosystem, I've had conversations with a maintainer about various issues and pull requests, and I’ve read 
the documentation and explored the code related to issue #4030.

Through my engagement with OpenSSF, I've gained a basic understanding of Go language syntax and learned how to effectively communicate 
with a community of developers to achieve positive project outcomes. I've also realized that responses from maintainers can take time, 
as they may have other commitments. Additionally, I've discovered that projects use "bots" for certain checks when pull requests are 
submitted, and I've learned how to properly conduct "check-ins" and "check-outs," also known as scrums.

By the end of this week, I aim to make a technical contribution to OpenSSF. While any contribution is valuable, I’m particularly eager to 
make a technical impact given my aspiration to pursue a career in software development. Additionally, I hope to gain experience working on 
a project that I haven’t encountered before.
