# Fifth Blog Post
In my first blog post, I expressed that I would like to improve on the skill of adaptability. Since making the first post, <br>
I believe that I have improved tremendously. Since I live on the east coast (a long way from west coast), I had to adapt <br>
to the different time zone and culture. In week one, I felt the days were so long and I could not just stop thinking about <br>
the time on the east coast. I assumed that this is because every one I know lives on the east coast. I can keep working <br> 
towards improving this skill from now and the end by getting out, seeing the city, and interacting with people in the <br>
city.
