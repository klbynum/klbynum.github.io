# Fifth Blog Post
In my initial blog post, I expressed my desire to enhance my adaptability skills. Since then, I believe I've made significant strides in this area. Living on the east coast while being far from the west coast has required me to adjust to different time zones and cultures.

During the first week, I found the days to be unusually long, constantly mindful of the time back on the east coast where everyone I know resides. To overcome this challenge, I am committed to continuing to improve my adaptability. I plan to achieve this by exploring the city, interacting with its people, and familiarizing myself with the area. This proactive approach will contribute to my growth in adaptability from now until the end of my journey.
