# HTOS Highlights
  When I started reading How to Open Source, I knew very little about open source. One concept that particularly resonated with me was “Face Your Contribution Fears.” This idea sparked my interest and motivated me to delve deeper into open source 
because it helped me build confidence in my abilities. The book reassures readers that feeling nervous or scared is normal and that they are not alone in these feelings. It also addresses imposter syndrome, where individuals believe others know 
more than they do, even if that’s not the case. I appreciate how this section welcomes newcomers by emphasizing that their skills and perspectives are valuable and needed in the open-source community.

During a Zoom call with Richard, the author of How to Open Source, on Thursday, July 26, 2024, he suggested that open-source programming can be similar to “performance art.” Initially, I interpreted this to mean that the development work done 
by maintainers and contributors is performed for an audience, which includes the public or users of the software or website. I believe this analogy is quite appropriate, as both involve creating something and presenting it to an audience. Both 
also requires a team of individuals, working together for the success of a project.

In his book, Richard writes, “The longer I’ve been employed as a professional coder, the more I realize that I’m paid […] for my ability to figure out things that I do not know quickly.” This statement aligns with my own experience in the tech 
industry. Companies understand that no one can know how to solve every issue, which is why teamwork and collaboration are essential. They primarily want you to be knowledgeable about important aspects like data structures, programming languages, 
and critical thinking when tackling problems. My involvement in the Catalyst program has further shaped my perspective, as I see professionals, like Richard, who are compensated for their contributions to open-source projects.
