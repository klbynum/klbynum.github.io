## Revisit Personal Goal
Reflecting on the personal goal I set for myself nearly eight weeks ago, I believe I successfully achieved it. My goal was to improve my adaptability, and after exploring various open-source organizations, examining their code, fixing issues, and submitting pull requests, I can confidently say that I’ve made significant progress. Additionally, I gained valuable experience using industry tools like Git, GitHub, Slack, and Discord, which will be beneficial when pursuing a software development job after graduation.

## Inventory of OpenSSF (Issues worked on for eight weeks)
| Issue #  | Description|
|----------|------------|
|[4030](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/4030) | This isssue wanted non-API links to the release notes for each release. The "good first issues" team (Silas, Jordin and I) explored the code and was able to successfully implement the desired non-API links(see figure 1 for undesired output and figure 2 for desired output).| 
|[4272](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/4272) | This is an issue opened by my team and I. We noticed in the `README.md` file, a command that was meant to be copied was placed in a "copy box" along with the output given when the command is ran. To avoid the command and output from being copied, we opened an issue to fix it. After opening this issue, no one has replied/commented on it (see figure 3).|
|[4247](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/4247) | The instructions and link found underneath "View a Project's Score" around line 99 in the README.md can be difficult to interpret. This can be difficult to interpret because the link is coming up as half a hyperlink and the other half just text. As a cohort (Silas, Jordin, Jeremiah, Elijah, and I) we updated the `README.md` so that it is more readable by placing backticks (``) around the template `https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=<github_or_gitlab>.com/<user_name_or_org>/<repository_name>` and this update was merge into the main.

## Reflection of Overall Experience
As a Catalyst Fellow, the most valuable insight I gained is that in the tech industry, it’s normal not to understand everything in the code on the first or even the second glance. Despite this, you can still successfully fix bugs without fully grasping every detail of the code. This experience has shown me that with the right tools and persistence, it's possible to contribute meaningfully, even in unfamiliar territory.
<br>
<br>
My time as a Catalyst Fellow has equipped me with the skills and confidence to continue contributing to open-source projects independently. I plan to stay engaged in the open-source community because it's a great way to gain experience across different programming languages, tackle real-world programming challenges, and enjoy a rewarding hobby at my own pace.
<br>
<br>
Looking ahead, I'm interested in exploring further opportunities in open source, including the possibility of starting an open-source research club or organization.
