## Revisit Personal Goal
Revisiting the personal goal that I set for myself nearly eight weeks, I feel like I was able to 100% successfully reach my goal. The 
goal was to improve my adaptability. After looking at different open-source organizations, exploring their code, fixing an issue, and 
submitting a PR, I would say I have improved a lot in adaptability.

## Inventory of OpenSSF (Issues worked on for eight weeks)
| Issue #  | Description|
|----------|------------|
|[4030](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/4030) | This isssue wanted non-API links to the release notes for each release. The "good first issues" team (Silas, Jordin and I) explored the code and was able to successfully implement the desired non-API links(see figure 1 for undesired output and figure 2 for desired output).| 
|[4272](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/4272) | This is an issue opened by my team and I. We noticed in the `README.md` file, a command that was meant to be copied was placed in a "copy box" along with the output given when the command is ran. To avoid the command and output from being copied, we opened an issue to fix it. After opening this issue, no one has replied/commented on it (see figure 3).|
|[4247](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/4247) | The instructions and link found underneath "View a Project's Score" around line 99 in the README.md can be difficult to interpret. This can be difficult to interpret because the link is coming up as half a hyperlink and the other half just text. As a cohort (Silas, Jordin, Jeremiah, Elijah, and I) we updated the `README.md` so that it is more readable by placing backticks (``) around the template `https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=<github_or_gitlab>.com/<user_name_or_org>/<repository_name>` and this update was merge into the main.                                                     |
