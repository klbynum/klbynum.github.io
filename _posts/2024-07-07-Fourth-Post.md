# Large-scale Project Evaluation
P5.js is a JavaScript library designed for creative coding, aimed at making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, 
beginners, and others interested in creative pursuits. It offers a comprehensive set of drawing

functions utilizing the HTML5 canvas element. 
P5.js is a collaborative effort involving numerous individuals, predominantly volunteers.

Currently, the project has 617 contributors in total, with recent activity showing that only 12 contributors have participated in the 
last 30 days, including three newcomers. The project remains active, with the most recent pull request made on July 7th, 2024. 
Prospective contributors are encouraged to consult the 'readme.md' file for guidance under the "Get Started" section.

Key technical documentation available includes installation instructions. Bug tracking is managed through the "Issues" tab, although it 
can be challenging to notice which issues are actively being addressed due to some pull requests remaining open post-issue resolution.

For those considering contributing, a realistic estimate for installation and setup is approximately two to three hours. 
Communication among developers typically occurs via a forum or Discord. The forum serves primarily as a platform for seeking assistance, 
while Discord serves multiple purposes including announcements, introductions, and mutual aid. Specific channels are dedicated to 
discussing code-of-conduct, sharing work, and suggesting improvements.

An intriguing aspect highlighted by this experience is that open-source involvement extends beyond mere contributions; it fosters community 
bonding, networking, and the formation of new connections. Engaging with a broader community can open doors to diverse opportunities and 
valuable resources. Ultimately, participating in open-source projects can be as much about who you connect with as what you contribute.
