# Motivation
- One challenge I aim to tackle with technology is enhancing the capabilities of TI-84 calculators to perform more advanced calculus calculations. Some calculus computations currently demand significant space, often spanning an entire page.
- When I achieve success, the first person I want to share it with is my mom. She's not only a software developer but also an exceptional mentor and role model throughout my college journey. Her guidance has consistently steered me towards success, and I'm incredibly grateful for her support in ensuring my post-graduation achievements
