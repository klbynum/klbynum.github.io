# This is my second post
- This is for Goal Setting
- When I achieve success, the first person I want to share it with is my mom. She's not only a software developer but also an exceptional mentor and role model throughout my college journey. Her guidance has consistently steered me towards success, and I'm incredibly grateful for her support in ensuring my post-graduation achievements.
