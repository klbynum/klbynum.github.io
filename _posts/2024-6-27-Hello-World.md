# Introduction
- My name is Kemon Bynum. I was born in Norfolk, Virginia but, I was raised in Augusta, Georgia. I am a undergraduate student at Norfolk State Univeristy. I am junior/senior studying computer science. After graduating, I plan to be a software developer.
- I currently have no experience with open source.
- I think the strongest skill that I can bring to my team is problem solving because I am pretty with researching issues that I may be having and thoroughly searching for answers.
- I think the skill that I would like to improve upon mostly is adaptability because everywhere you go, things are done differently and I have never really had to adapt to a different environment professionally but I do think it is a good skill to have because one might be switching companies and may have to adapt to a different culture or a new system.
